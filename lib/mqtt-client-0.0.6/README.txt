This JAR is a fork of the Eclipse MQTT Paho project, with the addition
of an ExecutorService to handle threading. This fork is used by the
http://joynr.io project to support MQTT in a JEE context. As this
modification is expected to be upstreamed into Paho shortly, it is
not recommended to use this JAR for non-joynr uses. Bugs etc. will
not be fixed in this fork.

Please use the official Paho release found here:
https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.java/
